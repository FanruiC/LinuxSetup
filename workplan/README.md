 ### Gilbert Strang Linear Algebra Contents:
- Lec 1: Row Picture (画图求交点，直接看出结果) / Colume Picture （画向量，估计可能的线性组合得到目标向量）
- Lec 2:
    - Gauss elimination matrices. 一个矩阵右乘和左乘 向量/矩阵 的区别 (左：行的线性组合得到新的行；右：列的线性组合得到新的列).
    - Permutation Matrices. How many?
    - 初等 Elimination matrices 的逆非常好求 
- Lec 3:
    - Four ways to do matrix multiplication: 单个元素/行法/列法/分块法
    - Inverses: why 一个矩阵没有逆？两种令人启发的解释
    - 求逆和解一系列的线性方程组一致，we're back to Gauss, and Jordan comes in. E[A I] = [EA EI] = [I A^-1]
- Lec 4:
    - A,B are invertible, (AB)的逆等于什么？ What's the inverse of A transpose?
    - If A is invertible, and no permutation matrice is needed, then EA = U, and E is lower triangular, then A = LU
    - LU = LDU, 一种行乘的理解迅速分解U求出DU
    - Lower triagnal means we are doing minus only row by row to the bottom. Why A=LU is better than EA=U? Try on a 4x4 example.
    - How many operations for LU decomposition for computer?
    - How many permutation matrices for a nxn square matrix? Answer: A(n,n)

- [ ] Gilbert Strang 同时教授[这些课程](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=Prof.+Gilbert+Strang)
## 20 Nov 23
- [ ] Learning Paraview visulisation techs.
- [ ] Reading literatures and decide the structures of the upcoming paper and the structures of the presentation slides, as well as the structures of upcoming simulations to do.<br>
      Three typical papers are: (Hufnagel et al. 2018) (Pier & Schmid 2017) (Lupi et al. 2020)
- [ ] Luchini / Bottaro , Adjoint equation in stability analysis.
- [x] Rebuild 3D model of the bent pipe including script. Done.
- [x] Running Re550, 94080 elements case
## 21 Nov 23
- [ ] Learning, Resovent Modes
- [ ] Reading, Drazan, Hydrodynamical Stability
## 23 Nov 23 Justin Meeting
- [ ] Tracking perturbation evolution at bend entrance and exit together with time. Plot the results. See [Justin's notes for me](https://github.com/FanruiC/LinuxSetup/blob/main/workplan/Fanrui.pdf)
### Ideas for uncoming work:
- [ ] Changing STROKE NUMBER, especially for large numbers
- [ ] Look at the stability of secondary modes, requires a stablisation algorithm.
- [ ] Test on rough mesh for parameter analysis first then apply to fine mesh.
- [ ] Investigate the influence of forced Womersley BCs on flows at bend. Especially when Re is high and probabally need a longer straight section.
- [ ] Investigate the influence of using a Sponge at both inlet and outlet, checking for any difference occurs at bend.
